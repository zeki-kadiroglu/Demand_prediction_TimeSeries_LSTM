#Bike Share
-In this project, the goal is to predict the number of future bike shares given the historical data of London bike shares.

-So this case should be handled as a time series problem with Bidirectional LSTM.

-In order to achieve this goal, you will make predictions with LSTM, unlike the machine learning algorithms you have applied before. 

-Long short term memory (LSTM) is an artificial repetitive neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning. 

-Unlike standard feed forward neural networks, LSTM has feedback links. It can process not only single data points but also entire data series.
